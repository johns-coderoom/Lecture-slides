## üëã Welcome

Welcome to my public repository of lecture slides and educational materials. This portfolio serves as a transparent record of my teaching philosophy, curriculum development, and dedication to creating clear, accessible, and engaging content for students.

I believe in the power of open educational resources (OER) and hope these materials can be a valuable resource for my students, fellow educators, and lifelong learners.

## üìö Courses & Materials

Below is a list of courses for which I have developed and delivered lectures. Each link leads to a dedicated folder containing the slides, typically in PDF format for easy viewing.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## üéØ My Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching is centered on three core principles:

*   **Clarity over Complexity:** I break down complex topics into digestible, logical steps.
*   **Application over Abstraction:** I use real-world examples and practical exercises to bridge theory and practice.
*   **Engagement over Passive Learning:** My slides are designed to be visual aids for an interactive classroom experience, prompting discussion and critical thinking.
